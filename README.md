## **Introduction**

The **Async Wallet Service** application is a REST API designed microâ€‘service that stores user balances in USD and TRY,
accepts deposit, withdrawal, and (optionally) currencyâ€‘exchange requests, publishes those requests to Kafka for
asynchronous processing, updates the database through a Kafka consumer, fetches live USDâ†”TRY rates with Redis caching,
and provides endpoints to check balances and the status of recent operations.
This project is implemented using **Spring Boot**, **Postgres**, **Kafka** and **Redis**, including **unit testing**,
and **containerization with Docker**.

## **How to Use**

### **Running the Application with Docker Compose**

1. Ensure you have **Docker** installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `dev` folder in the project directory.
3. Run the following command to build the application, run tests, and start the services:
   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```

This command will:

- Build the application using **Gradle**.
- Run unit tests.
- Start the application along with **Redis** and **Postgres** and **Kafka**.

1. Once the application is running, you can access the API using tools like **Postman** or **cURL**.
